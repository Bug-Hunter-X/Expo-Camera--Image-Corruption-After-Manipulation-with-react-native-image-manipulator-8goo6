# Expo Camera Image Corruption Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API in conjunction with image manipulation libraries, specifically `react-native-image-manipulator`. After capturing an image and processing it, the resulting image may appear corrupted or display incorrectly.

## Bug Description

The core problem lies in the interplay between the Expo Camera's image capture mechanism and the asynchronous image manipulation process.  The manipulated image's URI might not be fully ready or correctly formatted before being used to display it, leading to visual glitches or a blank image.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2.  `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the app on an iOS or Android simulator/device.
4. Take a picture using the app.
5. Observe the displayed image; it might be corrupted or blank.

## Solution

The provided solution addresses the issue by ensuring the image is fully processed before being used.
This includes checking if the image data is valid and retrying if it's corrupt.
