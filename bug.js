This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom image manipulation.  The issue is that after taking a picture, and performing operations on it (like resizing or cropping) using libraries such as `react-native-image-manipulator`, the resulting image is often corrupted or displays incorrectly when presented in an Image component. The image might show up as blank, distorted, or show the wrong data completely.

```javascript
// buggy code
import * as ImageManipulator from 'react-native-image-manipulator';

const takePicture = async () => {
  if (cameraRef.current) {
    const photo = await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync();
    const manipulatedImage = await ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync(
      photo.uri,
      [{ resize: { width: 300, height: 300 } }],
      { compress: 0.4, format: ImageManipulator.SaveFormat.JPEG }
    );
    setImage(manipulatedImage.uri);
  }
};
```
